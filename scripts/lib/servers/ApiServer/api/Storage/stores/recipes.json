Serve with the sauce on the side.\n\n- If you’re out of green onions, you can substitute them in the sauce with 1 shallot\n- A good way to use the spice mix is to put it in an empty spice jar and use that to sprinkle it evenly on the lamb chops.\n- This spice mix is delicious and great on so many things! We've tried it on beef, duck, even carbonara! Might be a good idea to make more than is needed for this dish and keep it around.\n- If you have sauce leftovers, it keeps well in the fridge for days in an airtight container. It may darken a bit due to the avocado but it still tastes good.",

    "title": "Papoutsakia",
    "description": "A traditional Greek dish that tastes very similar to moussaka, but is much quicker to cook. Fun fact: Papoutsakia in Greek means \"little shoes\" and a portion usually has two. However, when cooking with large American eggplants, you'll likely find that one per portion is enough.\n\nCut the eggplants in half and scoop out the center. Leave about 1-1.5cm of flesh. Carve the flesh crosswise.\n\nSeason the eggplants well with olive oil, salt, pepper, thyme. Use your hands to make sure it goes everywhere. Be fast, because they absorb the oil very quickly!\n\nPut eggplants on a large baking tray, cut side down and bake at 200C (392F) for 30-40 minutes.\n\n**Mince**: \n1. Fry the onions in the butter on high heat.\n2. Once the onions have started to caramelize, add the garlic and fry for a few more minutes.\n3. Add the cinnamon, cloves, allspice, black pepper and give it a stir.\n4. Add the mince and bay leaves and reduce heat to medium.\n5. Once the meat has started to brown, pour in the Metaxa.\n6. Add the tomato pureé, Sukrin Gold, bouillon base, and Worcestershire sauce and stir well.\n5. Reduce heat and simmer for about half an hour or until the tomato tastes cooked and any liquids have been reduced.\n\n**Béchamel:**\n1. Melt the butter in a small pot over low heat\n2. Whisk in the coconut flour, stirring continuously to make a roux\n3. When the roux ingredients are nicely combined, whisk in the cream, adding a little each time to avoid lumps\n4. Cook it over low heat, stirring continuously\n5. When it has thickened, add nutmeg, salt, pepper to taste\n6. Take it off the heat and stir in the yolks and grated cheese\n\nScoop the minced meat into the eggplants, and top it with the béchamel. Bake for 10 minutes at 200C (392F), checking frequently because ovens vary. You may want to turn on the grill (US: broiler) for the last 5 minutes to give the cheese a nice golden brown.",

Tip: pour the wine into the tomato paste jar and shake it to get the last of the paste out.\n\nAdd canned tomatoes, cumin, caraway seeds, bay leaves, paprika, erythritol, concentrated stock, and pepper. Yes, that is a lot of cumin; it will be fine. Bring to low boil, reduce heat, simmer for 20 min\n\nPlace de-stemmed Swiss chard leaves on top of cooked tomato mixture. Make 8 small depressions with a spoon\n\nCrack one egg into each depression. Cover (a transparent lid is ideal)\n\nCook until egg white is _just_ set. Serve immediately, in the pan.\n\n- The tomato sauce keeps for a couple of days in the fridge. If eating over two days, crack only 4 eggs. Next time, reheat sauce then make 4 more depressions and crack the other 4.\n- We use Sukrin Gold erythritol, which looks and tastes like light brown sugar. If not low-carbing, demarara or other sugar can be substituted.\n- Bell peppers are bad for absorbing pesticides, so we always use organic because the skin is eaten.\n- The type of red wine is not critical, honestly. We use small (187ml) “individual” bottles of fairly cheap red wine.",

Repeat until it's soft, usually doesn’t need more than 2 minutes total.\n\nAdd the eggs and mix gently.\n\nPut a piece of parchment paper over your pizza stone, add the dough on top of it and then another piece of parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to roll it as close as possible to the pizza stone shape and evenly around 5mm thick or less. Remove the top sheet of parchment paper.\n\nMake fork holes all over the pizza base to ensure it cooks evenly.\n\nBake at 215C/420F for 15 minutes or until golden brown.\n\nIf you can manage to flip the pizza over without breaking it, flip it and bake a bit longer to make it crispy. If you’re worried it will break don't flip it, we never do and it’s fine!\n\nWhile the base is baking, make the tomato sauce: in a mini-blender of food processor blend the tomato paste, garlic wine, basil, Worcestershire sauce, oregano. Cook at medium-low heat for 5-10 minutes or until thickened a bit.\n\nWhile the base is baking and the sauce simmering, cut the bacon into 5mm lardons and sauté with the mushrooms until almost (but not completely) cooked to your liking.\n\nOnce the pizza base is done, spread the sauce over it as evenly as you can (a brush or rubber spatula helps). Then add the remaining grated cheeses, the bacon, the mushrooms, the pepper, the pineapple.\n\nBroil at 260C/500F for about 5 minutes, checking frequently because ovens vary. Enjoy!",

Season with black pepper.\n\nContinue to fry until mushrooms release their liquid and are turning darker. \n\nIn a separate pan, fry the pepper in the coconut oil until softened and just starting to turn brown.\n\nAdd garlic to the mushrooms and stir until fragrant.\n\nAdd thyme and stir. Then add a generous splash of Worcestershire sauce.\n\nPour the cream into the mushrooms, bring to a low boil, then reduce heat.\n\nAdd the green peppers\n\nWhen the cream reduces a bit, add the grated cheese and stir until melted.\n\nGrate the nutmeg into the mixture and serve.\n\n- If you can find smoked cheddar, use a mixture of 50% smoked cheddar and 50% normal cheddar (it's very strong so not 100%). \n- Don’t allow the cream to overcook or it will separate!\n- You can probably cook the pepper in with the mushrooms and ignore the coconut oil, if desired.",

It will look very runny at first, that's normal. When it starts darkening and becoming more viscous, add the cinnamon and sweetener. \n4. When it's light brown and most of the the ghee has been absorbed, it's about done. At that point, add the vanilla extract. It will foam, that's ok. Stir until it goes down again.\n5. Press into a 9\" springform cake tray. Let it cool down in the fridge.\n\n**Cream**: With a mixer beat the mascarpone on its own for a bit, then add icing sugar substitute to taste, then the rest of the ingredients. Blend until even. If you want the cheesecake to be extra fluffy, just beat it longer. Make sure the ghee in the bottom layer has solidified, then spread over the base in the cake tray. Put it back in the fridge.\n\n**Topping**: Blend half of the fruits and cut the other half into slices. Using a small pot, heat up the blended strawberries, Sukrin Gold, lemon juice and stir frequently until all heated up and mixed well. Add the gelatin slowly by sprinkling and stirring so that it doesn't clump. Then add the sliced fruits and stir. Simmer for a bit, then take it off the heat and let it cool down a bit. Once it starts getting viscous, spread it over the cream and put it back in the fridge.\n\nChill in the fridge for at least 3 hours, then enjoy!\n\n- We use Sukrin Gold and Sukrin Icing for sweetening. We've tried many and think those are as close as it gets to the sugar equivalents and have no aftertaste.\n- You can use less mascarpone, the middle layer will just be less thick.
